# Bamba Stars - ETH Samba 2024

## Basic Information
- *Project Name:* Bamba Stars
- *Project Team Members:* Luiz, Bryan and Daniel
- *Project Establishment Date:* 2024, March


## Introduction


We are, besides developers, individuals who are always at the forefront of web3 technology and keeping up with all the ecosystem's news. With the emergence of frames technology, we saw that it has enormous potential for the "creator economy," providing various benefits not only for the influencer but for their entire follower network, all within social media applications.


### Problem & Solution

One of the most common problems encountered when considering raising money through funds is the high fees charged by banks and also the lack of credibility that banks have with their customers. To solve this problem, Bamba Stars emerges, a platform that allows the creator to advertise their projects and has their followers as a social validator. This not only facilitates the funding process by allowing it in just one click but also serves as a social validator because all actions that any individual takes in the network will be stored and linked to the user themselves.


### Technology

- Frames: Allows this interaction with a single click within the social network
- Scaffold-eth-2: Base tool of the web app
- Chain abstraction on Near: Enables and facilitates direct payment
- Scroll: Using zk to enable secure information exchange on the network
